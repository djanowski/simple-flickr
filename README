DESCRIPTION:

  This is an interface into the Flickr REST API. There are a bunch of various libraries that do this, 
  but most of the ones I found are out of date and no longer work with the new(ish) Flickr API,
  partially work, or resulted in general funkyness. 
  
  At the moment, this does what I need. Feel free to do what you want with it, and let me know if 
  you make changes, fix bugs, or add any features - i'd be more than happy to accept any patches!

FEATURES/PROBLEMS: 

  This currently only provides a wrapper around public data (non-authenticated stuff), but it would not be
  too tricky to add authenticated stuff in at a later date, should it be needed. 

  This currently provides wrapping for people, photos, and photosets. For anything else, you can use the 
  Flickr::Client#request and get hpricot documents back, which are easy to parse... or, submit a patch with the missing
  wrappers!

SYNOPSIS:

   client = Flickr::Client.new( 'apikey' )
   person = client.person( 'jerrett taylor' ) 
   => #<Flickr::Person:0x11e5e14 ...>>
   person.photosets.first.title
   => "Macro"
   person.photosets.first.photos
   => [#<Flickr::Photo:0x116ab10 ...>

REQUIREMENTS: 
  - Hpricot
